In 2017, the fossil fuel industry persuaded the provincial government to delay and weaken its methane rules, which were then accepted by the federal government in 2020 as being in compliance with its own.\r\nRick Smith, president of the Canadian Climate Institute, also said delaying the methane deadline was unnecessary. “If there is one no-brainer of climate change policy, it is enhanced reduction of methane emissions from oil and gas,” he said in a statement.",

Oil prices are low compared with a few years ago, forcing the industry to cut costs and pare back spending, while green energy sources like solar power and wind power are becoming ever cheaper. Canada’s oilsands produce oil that is heavier and full of more sulphur than other blends around the world, meaning it’s more complex and expensive to refine and so must compete with lower-cost operations.",
